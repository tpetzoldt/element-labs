# Introduction

The following example is based on the classical OECD study on
"Eutrophication of Inland Waters" from @Vollenweider1980, that,
among others, describes the relationship between annual mean
chlorophyll concentration and annual mean total phosphorus in lakes.
A website about aspects of this study can be found on
[https://www.chebucto.ns.ca/ccn/info/Science/SWCS/TPMODELS/OECD/oecd.html](https://www.chebucto.ns.ca/ccn/info/Science/SWCS/TPMODELS/OECD/oecd.html)

We use a data set that was taken manually from the figure below. It is
of course not exactly the original data set, but should be sufficient
for our purpose.

<!--
The analysis is performed using 
the R Language of statistical computing [@RCore] and the RStudio IDE [@RStudio].
-->

![Dependency of chlorophyll a on total phosphorus (Reproduced Figure 6.1 from Vollenweider and Kerekes 1980)](../img/vollenweider-chl-tp.png){width=40%}



This data set contains annual average concentrations of total
phosphorus (TP, $\mathrm{\mu g L^{-1}}$) and chlorophyll a (CHLa,
$\mathrm{\mu g L^{-1}}$) of 92 lakes.  A few points were overlapping
on the original figure, so that 2 lakes are missing.

## Methods

Download `oecd.csv` from the course web page and copy it to a suitable
folder. The first row contains the variable names (`header=TRUE`) and
don't forget to set the working directory to the correct location:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat <- read.csv("oecd.csv")
```

Now, inspect the data set in RStudio. The columns contain an ID number
(No), phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll (CHLa) concentration and a last
column indicating the limitation type of the lake: P: phosphorus
limitation, N: nitrogen limitation and I: light limitation.

## Correlation coefficient

First we want to know how much chlorophyll and phosphorus depend on
each other.  For this purpose, we calculate the Pearson and Spearman
correlations and test it for significance:

```{r, eval=FALSE,fig=FALSE}
plot(dat$TP, dat$CHLa)
cor.test(dat$TP, dat$CHLa)
cor.test(dat$TP, dat$CHLa, method="spearman")
cor.test(rank(dat$TP), rank(dat$CHLa))
```

Compare the values and discuss the results. The last line is just an
alternative way to estimate **Spearman** correlation if ties (several
times the same value) occur.

## Linear Regression


Now lets fit a linear regression (`lm` means linear model) and save
the result into a new object `reg`. This object can now be used to
plot the regression line (`abline`) or to extract regression
statistics (`summary`):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(dat$TP, dat$CHL)
reg <- lm(dat$CHLa ~ dat$TP)
abline(reg)
summary(reg)
```

# Exercise

## Repeat the analysis with log transformed data

The results indicate that one of the most important pre-requisites of
linear regression, namely "variance homogeneity" was violated. This
can be seen from the fan-shaped pattern where most of the data points
are found in the lower left corner. A logarithmic transformation of
both variables can help here, so we should repeat the analysis with
the logarithms of TP and CHLa.



```{r, eval=FALSE,fig=FALSE}
x <- log(dat$TP)
y <- log(dat$CHLa)
plot(x, y)
reg <- lm(y ~x)
abline(reg)
summary(reg)
```

## Confidence intervals

Confidence and prediction intervals are useful to demonstrate
uncertainty of the regression line and for predictions. The following
code shows an example with test data.

```{r, eval=TRUE,fig=TRUE,out.width='52%'}
x <- 1:10
y <- 2 + 3 * x + rnorm(10, sd=2)
plot(x, y)
reg <- lm(y ~ x)

newdata <- data.frame(x=seq(min(x), max(x), length=100))
conflim <- predict(reg, newdata=newdata, interval="confidence")
predlim <- predict(reg, newdata=newdata, interval="prediction")
lines(newdata$x, conflim[,2], col="blue", lty="dashed") 
lines(newdata$x, conflim[,3], col="blue", lty="dashed")
lines(newdata$x, predlim[,2], col="red", lty="solid") 
lines(newdata$x, predlim[,3], col="red", lty="solid")

abline(reg)
```

The result of `predict` is a matrix with 3 columns:

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
head(predict(reg, newdata = newdata, interval = "confidence"), 3)
```

* the first column contains the fit,
* the second and 3rd column the confidence resp. prediction intervals. 

You can also find this out yourself by reading the documentation (`?predict`) or by 
inspecting `conflim` and `predlim` in the RStudio object explorer.


The data frame `newdata` contains $x$ values for the prediction. Please note
that the variable name (e.g. `x` or `log_TP`) must be exactly the same as in the `lm`-function!

# Tasks

## Course task

Combine your solution for the log-transformed chlorophyll-phosphorus
regression with the confidence interval example, to reproduce the
appearance of OECD Figure.  Discuss the results.


## Self study

1. Inform yourself about the background of eutrophication, the
  classical OECD study [@Vollenweider1980] and recent developments.
  Read Section 6 and 6.1 of the OECD report and find additional
  references.

2. Discuss the results of the Exercises above and back-transform the
  double logarithmic equation to linear scale using the **laws of
  logs** on a sheet of paper:

\begin{align}
    \log(y) & = a + b \log(x) \\
    y       & = \dots
\end{align}

3. Compare the equation with the equation in Figure 6.1. of the OECD
  report.

4. Repeat the analysis for the P-limited data only: add confidence
  intervals, back-transform the equation and compare it with the
  equation in Fig. 6.1 of the report

5. Optional: The axes of the own plots are log-transformed, and the
  annotations show the log.  This is not easy to read. Find a way to
  annotate the axes with the original (not log-transformed) values as
  in the original report and add grid lines.

Note: if you need help, contact your learning team members or ask in
the matrix chat.

## Notes


**Difference between corelation and regression**

* **correlation** measures whether a linear or monotonous dependency
    exists

* **regression** describes the relationship with a mathematical model


**Example how to use a subset**


We can create a plot with different plotting symbols, by making the
plotting character `pch` dependent on the limitation type

```{r,eval=FALSE}
plot(dat$TP, dat$CHL, pch = dat$Limitation)
```

Another method using plotting symbols employs conversion from
character to a factor and then to a numeric:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
plot(dat$TP, dat$CHL, pch = as.numeric(factor(dat$Limitation)))
```

The following shows one approach for subsetting direcly in the
`lm`-function.  It is of course also possible to use a separate
`subset` function before calling `lm`.


```{r,eval=FALSE}
reg <- lm(CHLa ~ TP, data = dat, subset = (Limitation == "P"))
# ...
```
